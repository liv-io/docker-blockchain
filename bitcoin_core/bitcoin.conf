# Assume that this block hash and its ancestors are valid. Skip their script verification (performance boost.) Set to 0 to verify all blocks. We recommend leaving value blank.

# Specify the location of the configuration file. To use non-default location, create a default location config file containing this setting.

# Bind to given address and always listen on it. Use [host]:port notation for IPv6.

# Disable expensive verification for known chain history.

# [rpc]
# Accept command line and JSON-RPC commands.
server=1
# Bind to given address to listen for JSON-RPC connections. This option is ignored unless -rpcallowip is also passed. Port is optional and overrides -rpcport. Use [host]:port notation for IPv6. This option can be specified multiple times. (default: 127.0.0.1 and ::1 i.e., localhost, or if -rpcallowip has been specified, 0.0.0.0 and :: i.e., all addresses)

# Username and hashed password for JSON-RPC connections. The field <userpw> comes in the format: <USERNAME>:<SALT>$<HASH>. RPC clients connect using rpcuser=<USERNAME>/rpcpassword=<PASSWORD> arguments. You can generate this value with the ./share/rpcauth/rpcauth.py script in the Bitcoin Core repository. This option can be specified multiple times.
rpcauth=satoshi
rpcpassword=3EhTcDs5XZFeA4pRnd7tQJj8jE9H53pg
# Allow JSON-RPC connections from specified source. Valid for <ip> are a single IP (e.g. 1.2.3.4), a network/netmask (e.g. 1.2.3.4/255.255.255.0) or a network/CIDR (e.g. 1.2.3.4/24). This option can be specified multiple times.

# [wallet]
# Do not load the wallet and disable wallet RPC calls.
disablewallet=1


# [Sections]
# Most options automatically apply to mainnet, testnet, and regtest networks.
# If you want to confine an option to just one network, you should add it in the relevant section.
# EXCEPTIONS: The options addnode, connect, port, bind, rpcport, rpcbind and wallet
# only apply to mainnet unless they appear in the appropriate section below.

# Options only for mainnet
[main]

# Options only for testnet
[test]

# Options only for regtest
